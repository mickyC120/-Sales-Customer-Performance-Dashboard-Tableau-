# 📊 Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

## 🧠 Background & Business Context
In a competitive retail landscape, visibility into **sales performance** and **customer behavior** is crucial for driving sustainable growth.  
This project simulates a real-world executive analytics solution designed to empower sales and marketing leaders with interactive insights that guide **revenue optimization**, **customer retention**, and **strategic decision-making**.

Two integrated Tableau dashboards were developed:
- **Sales Performance Dashboard** — helps executives track revenue, profit, and product trends.
- **Customer Insights Dashboard** — enables marketing teams to analyze customer loyalty, order frequency, and profitability.

Together, they deliver an end-to-end view of commercial performance.
