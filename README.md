# 📊 Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

## 🧠 Background & Business Context
In today’s competitive retail landscape, visibility into both **sales performance** and **customer behavior** is essential for driving growth.  
This project simulates a real-world scenario where a retail company’s leadership team needs **data-driven insights** to monitor sales performance, understand purchasing trends, and optimize customer engagement strategies.

Two interconnected Tableau dashboards were developed:
- **Sales Performance Dashboard** — for executives and sales managers to assess revenue, profit, and product trends.
- **Customer Insights Dashboard** — for marketing and management teams to understand customer loyalty, profitability, and retention behavior.

Together, they function as a unified business intelligence solution to align sales, marketing, and operational decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective
Design and deploy interactive Tableau dashboards that:
- Track **year-over-year performance** in sales, profit, and order quantity.  
- Identify **seasonal sales trends**, **top-performing products**, and **lagging categories**.  
- Provide a **customer-centric view** highlighting loyalty, order frequency, and top contributors to profit.  
- Enable **filterable, data-driven exploration** for management and team leads.

## 💼 Business Value
This dashboard delivers measurable business value by enabling:
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time visibility into revenue, profit, and quantity trends helps management stay proactive.  
- **Strategic Decision-Making:** Clear identification of high-performing product lines and customer segments supports pricing and promotion strategies.  
- **Customer Retention:** Customer behavior insights guide loyalty and retention campaigns.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Sales managers can prioritize underperforming regions or product categories and take corrective actions faster.
